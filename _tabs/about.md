# Hi

I'm Mike, a Software Developer with ~10 years of experience of working with the
.NET Framework and C# across various platforms and implementations.

I especially have a fascination with scripting languages that are dynamic, functional
and / or have metaprogramming facilities baked in as a first class concept.

Aside from this, I collect mechanical keyboards, typically that run atop the awesome
QMK Firmware.

Finally, outside of programming I love rowing on a Concept2 Rowing Machine at my
local gym, having recently completed a half marathon in just over 2 hours!
